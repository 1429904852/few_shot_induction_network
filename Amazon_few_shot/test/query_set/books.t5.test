one reviewer stated , reviewer who criticized this book basis his antagonism religious faith missed point . i would go further state he showed weakness his own thinking process . true science religious faith neutral . conduct good scientific experiements , question god left out process . this no means implies scientist not hold personal opinion subject , either or against . it merely means he or she suspends personal belief interest conducting good experiments . further , number people who hold certain position regarding faith , neither makes faith valid nor makes it invalid . professor personal faith atheism . religious faith , every bit much theism , creationism , or any other many isms this world . this very adequately demonstrated his intollerant review . he takes extreme position opposite side radical creationists , but no more defensible then radical creationists ' views . he even goes so far suggest scientists ( some whom nobel prize winners ) who seem think belief god not unreasonable , not intelligent . now book itself . i find it very fascinating look process how many world great scientific minds approach questions addressed this book . people questioned take positions across spectrum belief/disbelief . book includes number answers those who not believe god . i found process approach very well , ask reasonable questions . this book i think worth reading no matter whether you believe god or don't . thinking process never hurt hearing opinions differ your own	1

i always admired architecture . i love wandering through cities , marvelling their skyscrapers , travelling europe see older buildings . i bought " world history architecture " so i could better understand not only beauty these buildings , but their place architectural history . " world history " exceeded my expectations . its sixteen chapters describe characteristics innovations architecture major movements . you learn what makes gothic architecture gothic , romanesque romanesque . " world history " also explains how these styles developed eachother . although appearance might suggest otherwise , today skyscrapers descendants parthenon pantheon . not all chapters describe western styles , however . there long , interesting sections egyptian , indian , chinese , islamic pre-columbian american architecture . authors explain how these types influenced western architecture , something i never realized . it fascinating read islamic mosques source many concepts found medieval cathedrals , mayan buildings inspired some frank lloyd wright work . book well written full beautiful pictures illustrate ideas described text . i don't think there single page devoid pictures , which alone make book interesting leaf through . my only complaints concern hefty price bulky size . this more textbook than bedroom reading . i found it uncomfortable lay down couch read this , or even sit armchair . it best read sitting desk , like your chemistry textbook high school . otherwise , " world history " perfect . read this , i feel like i completed architectural class . this book gave me knowledge architectural history i cant wait use my next vacation	1

this book spurred tv specials recieved many rave reviews . after getting sucked into one many tv specials talking counting cards beating vegas i decided look into issue this book , i heard , `one ' read . while reading book i found it extremely hard put down i essentially goose bumps imagining pure brilliance these college kids . book absolutely amazing , story 6 brilliant mit students who taught math professor how count cards pass these counts other teammates unknown security other casino personnel . counting 312 cards included 6 deck shoe getting accurate count unbelievable . book goes into great detail explaining all members team . reason one man team would impossible pull off because raising your bet after cards got hot , lowering betting cards cooled off , would seen very suspicious dealer you would made known security . using intricate team how millions dollars made . first member team start out table placing minimum bet every single hand while counting cards ( high card , 9 -ace , counts -1 , while low card , 2-6 , counts +1 . thus high count means many low cards drawn out shoe leaving many high cards ) . this team member generally dressed very modestly doesn't draw too much attention themselves . after count gets `hot ' this member call big spender . big spender gambler who attracts all attention , wearing extravagant clothing betting large sums money nearly every hand . after big spender seated count must passed , most crucial part entire operation . passing count without two teammates acknowledging each other . let say count +8 , after few hands them both table minimum better leave table making comment dealer such , `well i think my luck up , i'm going go hang out pool while . ' word pool not reference casinos swimming pool but actually game pool which 8 ball commonly associated . simple comment teammates never look each other while passing very vital information nearly undetectable dealer or casinos high tech security equipment , pure brilliance . true art counting cards count cards while so animated , or seemingly uninterested cards seems untrained eye you not actually counting cards . although counting cards not technically illegal it not something casinos permit . games located casinos house advantage but once advantage swings way gamblers , casino all its powers individual removed . once card counter caught they generally asked leave premises banned life . this book something everyone , good way pass time plane trip or great book read vacation get your blood pumping . i would recommend this book anyone enjoys reading thrillers , or books show underdog consistently beating heavy favorite , because after all , how you not root underdog ? brian bowe	1

when this book came out last year , i remember it uniformly dismissed garbage - mostly result accusations embedded within this tome pages regarding rafael palmeiro steroid user . well , quite bit changed since book release - congressional hearing , raffy testing positive steroids , continued growth barry bonds ' noggin . , amazingly , amid all hue cry over steroid usage baseball over past year , this reviewer finds jose canseco sanest voice debate over steroids . juiced not simply canseco love letter steroids . he uniformly unapologetic his steroid use - which slightly disturbing , yes - but his candor over fact he would merely average baseball player it not his steroid usage actually very impressive . i tired vainglorious ballplayer retrospective loooooong ago - middle school , point fact - yet , i thoroughly impressed canseco account here because there unusual amount self-awareness one would not expect any ballplayer . plus , it actually highly readable - i stop short saying " well-written " because keats this obviously not , but surprisingly engaging clearly written . while this book revelation sorts one makes likes messrs . mcgwire , sosa , palmeiro , bonds look like utter cowards not more forthright baseball-following public over their accomplishments , i still urge degree caution reading this book , particularly little-league set . this sort book i would , impressionable little leaguer , wanted desperately read . mr. canseco little too enthusiastic benefits steroids - such way one whose sense skepticism not yet fully developed could read it advertisement proverbial " b-12 " shots . also , it seems bit self-serving places regard his spousal abuse rap , somewhat unfairly takes cal ripken , jr. without any substantive reasons why . notwithstanding these criticisms , anyone whose innocence vis-a-vis baseball long since shattered , i actually highly recommend this book . how strange it canseco may ultimately come out steroid era player most unscathed - if so , it largely strength " juiced " . not literary masterpiece , but definitely among strongest baseball genre	-1
i bought this book few years ago recommendation professor labor history . history often told point view " winners " , so i thought it would good absorb perspective not usually taught . i admit all history form narrative , there no " pure " facts history since all narratives make value judgments least implicitly . but some narratives " work " better than others ; some narratives enshrine values would better us hold than others . some ways understanding past more helpful , thus more correct , than others . narrative presented this book not very helpful same reason ruling-class narratives unhelpful : both heroic narratives . only difference those who play role hero those who play marginalized switched places . history far too complex process - story - say " so-and-so responsible such-and-such " . this case , we learn poor laborers , minorities , women , immigrants " really " responsible america accomplishments . course , this partially correct , it surely case we would not where we it not these groups . but imply educated white men - people like two authors book themselves - made little " real " contribution america accomplishments but instead responsible all our social failings preposterous . this simply swing pendulum opposite extreme . fact , i think whole project parcelling out persons into groups , then telling group-based historical narrative problematic . which group defines your identity ? failing this book it mistakes part whole , necessary sufficient . much better narrative includes marginalized working class found howard zinn * people history united states * . i gave book two stars instead one because writing quite good - just like absorbing historical fiction	-1
this huge , comprehensive biography robert moses , same time examination flaws early mid twentieth century urban planning . it told considerable gusto ( times perhaps too much caro passions tend run high exposed through his prose , thus losing its dispassionate nature ) . although subject matter might not first sight stir blood those not interested urban planning or who not live new york , it really fascinating read . that because it works two levels : firstly tragedy traditional sense term hero ( moses ) carried high then destroyed his own character ; but importantly caro draws lessons learned unbalanced transport policies - over-reliance cars expense other means transportation . lessons there learned - merely building more roads serves increase traffic rather than ease congestion . lack sound relocation policy where people moved due public works creates new slums destroys established communities . it unfortunate these lessons still learned , or yet learned both developing world ( try crossing road bangkok ! ) even west ( how badly london needs better public transport ) . caro book long , but style makes his later multi-volume biography lyndon johnson so enjoyable already there : finishing work , you won't indifferent robert moses , nor what his manner urban development meant continues mean . rodgers	1

this extensive , almost minute-by-minute account final days nixon administration , leading up abrupt conclusion his resignation august 9 , 1974 . woodward bernstein continued very thorough investigation political writing they started their masterpiece " all president men , " though it would nice if this book more intensively tied one . this book certainly full informative details , though there some gaps continuity woodward bernstein overall reporting vast convoluted watergate scandal ( if you wish consult their works first ) . this book also lacking suspense thrill journalistic discovery made " all president men " such enjoyable read , here two reporters sacrifice some brevity readability their efforts leave absolutely no stone unturned , they cover intricate political developments legal shenanigans . some more knowledge fates nixon various cronies co-conspirators would also beneficial reader . but good side , we learn lot nixon ruinous quest fight evidence mounting against him his stubborn refusal face reality , forthright but misguided efforts his faithful staff delay inevitable ( chief staff alexander haig makes especially strong impression this book ) , efforts nixon family political allies provide moral support . most important revelation this book nixon didn't necessarily resign because he succumbed evidence his criminal conduct , but he actually forced into it other republican leaders who trying save their own political skins . we also see human side richard nixon , his sense loyalty leadership good side , his stubbornness vindictiveness instability bad side .

one hardest things anyone learn , no matter where you life , or how much money you , coping times when things don't turn out you expect . some people never recover , while others seem sail past disaster hardly break stride . trick isn't what disaster , but how they've handled it . longtime author harold . kushner , best known his when bad things happen good people , takes intriguing look ability cope using figure moses bible . yes , moses . out all various people torah , he undoubtably most complex . most us tend visualize him certain actor hollywood , brawny , noble imposing , able smite down miscreants when single blow , but those who studied moses bible find someone bit more closer earth . if anyone deal disappointment , it certainly moses . called upon lead captive jews out egypt , facing down most powerful ruler earth , it seems once he got them out wilderness sinai , things ought improving . instead , what happening when he returns first set tablets ? why , they're worshipping idol shape golden calf . it doesn't even stop there -- throughout forty years exile , people complain thirst , hunger , -- enough make anyone throw up their hands disgust walk away . perhaps most bitter all , moses denied entry into promised land , only allowed glimpse goal he worked so hard he dying . you admit , that quite disappointment . but not once during all these setbacks , moses tell god he gives up . he might protest he might not able handle burden , but he try complete it . it this message rabbi kushner uses best effect this book , giving positive use times when disappointment enters our lives , not give up . society where it seems perfection demanded , failure viewed moral failing rather than something occurs every person life , getting view across disappointment means building character rather than sign you're not going amount much . it not very long book , easily read within few hours time , but contents informative meaningful . rabbi kushner writing style very fluid readable , keeping technical jargon , while he go off tangents regularly , he never forgets what he talking . only problem i tangents occured quite bit , occansionally annoying . still , despite flaws , it good book , earned four stars i gave it overall . more importantly , it gives positive human message reassuring needed our rather complicated , perfectionist society , one sorely needed .	-1

there very few memoirs published record producers , especially producers important george martin , producer ? discovererquot ; beatles . i call it memoir because that what it - much more covered than beatles . this book george martin , through through . first 100 pages or so recount martin early history british military up through his first job recording industry . there staggering detail this , naming even most insignificant people he met way . but since we know this all contributing what would become martin genius , it really isn't all tedious . eventually we come chapter beatles - how he discovered them , how he recorded them , then single singe , how they became biggest band world . whether he intends it or not , there epic quality practically every word martin writes ( or rather , ghostwritten him ) . professional today music industry seeing literally all music recorded computers , it fascinating see technology they working . he writes actually recording * wax records * . it also nice see someone getting so excited advent stereo recording . it something we don't even think today , but producers martin era , recording stereo profound recording hard drives today . i also amazed learn he made almost no money off beatles records . today , comparable producer - say glenn ballard , alanis ' former producer - probably made dozens millions dollars . martin didn't earn any royalties those records , he also refused ownership stake publishing company set up exclusively beatles songs . this probably cost him upwards $ 50,000,000 if not more . he goes say he no regrets refusing ownership , whether or not you believe him , he lay out pretty impressive spiel not doing it money . i arrived conclusion , however , while genius producer he possibly world worst businessman . hundreds people made millions off beatles one closest them - martin - managed make almost nothing . truly staggering . this kind book that must-have beatles fan or aspiring musician , proselytize everyone else . classic book classic producer .	1

alright , when you read mainstream piece contemporary fiction author such james patterson , john grishom , tom clancy , like , you not expecting life altering experience like reading shakespeare or hemingway . this not high literature , but rather pure entertainment , without much required thinking involved . " four blind mice " action packed , entertaining , doesn't burden reader complications such thinking . there aren't complex social interactions , terribly dynamic characters , or social commentaries would get way simply enjoying fun adventure . english professors love hate these kinds books . they believe time reading would better spent only literature highest caliber . english professors , however , ones who took enjoyment out reading millions people , making them overanalyze learn hate fiction . therefore , it any surprise today reading literature all time lows , fewer fewer people picking up novels more more turning mindless programming television . personally i love read high literature . it enlightening , often challenges your values , or helps one understand differing points view . other hand , however , sometimes ( call it guilty pleasure ) i simply want read something i don't think much . it times like this i turn james patterson or john grishom novel . plot " four blind mice " wasn't very complex ; rather it unfolded mostly predictably . characters mostly flat , without much way development . i felt no better read this book . i wouldn't want it any other way	-1

throughout pat buchanan fascinating illustrious career , even his closest friends admirers detected certain reluctance his part engage issue race . his newest book , state emergency , mr. buchanan finally concedes accurate examination plight u.s. immigration futile without resort lens racial identity . book begins quoting arnold toynbee , giant among historians , " civilizations perish suicide , not murder . " within toynbee paradigm , civilizational suicide promoted any three " imminent , mortal perils " : dying populations , disintegrating cultures , unresisted invasions . ever historian , himself , mr. buchanan then illustrates history most dramatic precedent our dilemma , fall roman empire fifth century , not long after emperor valens granted asylum large band gothic refugees who appeared rome gates . within two years , these ingrates barbarians sacked city murdered valens , himself , eventually precipitating roman empire move istanbul , ushering dark ages . case anyone should miss analogy , author then draws parallel george bush , his favorable attitude toward third world immigration requisite amnesty . scope problemthe scope problem immense sobering , mr. buchanan not disappoint those who find statistics useful measure its gravity . example : * 36 million immigrants their offspring now living u.s. greater than all immigration u.s. 1607 1960 ; * approximately half eight million foreigners who entered u.s. 2000 2005 , so illegally ; * one 12 illegal immigrants criminal ; * 10% 20% all mexican , central american caribbean peoples now live u.s. ; * there may 20 million illegal immigrants currently residing here ; racial imperativeas informed americans already know , current wave third world immigration invading our shores differs markedly all earlier waves immigrants variety ways . today immigrants not products western , judeo-christian civilization , desiring assimilate adopt american " ethos " : rather , this new wave immigrants consist such alien backward peoples bantus somalia , ( who never heard indoor plumbing , ) mestizos central america , who apparently won't use latter even when available ! here buchanan breaks new ground his candid acknowledgement truism : " people create cultures : cultures don't create people . " other words cultures reflection talent creativity people : merely allowing alien individual access superior culture not imbue individual talents characteristics thrive this new environment , nor even appreciate i t.t here good reasons many aliens wish leave squalor they helped create back home , equally good reasons oppose their coming here , so prevent their doing u.s. which they've already their homelands . owing inexplicable " multiculturalist " zeal academia elite news media last 25 years or so , we permitted foreign nationals emigrate this country who less educated , less intelligent , less appreciative our cultural " ethos " than any wave immigrants before them . result , they far less capable assimilation , even if their numbers far fewer . solutionsin his final chapter , author proposes number intriguing solutions problem , which roughly categorized four ways : physical barriers ; electoral remedies ; economic disincentives ; legal reforms . combination , these designed avoid expense difficulty deportation , favor policy attrition . briefly , his proposal physical barrier deter invasion our southern border consists 2 fifteen foot-high fences erected immediately inside u.s. border , two-lane road them permit border patrol travel either direction . supplementing these , buchanan proposes motion sensors alert border patrol , second wall eight foot " coiled wire . " beyond this , he suggests deep ditches prevent further penetration border vehicles used smuggle drugs humans , should any successfully penetrate earlier obstacles . author claims these physical barriers could built $8 billion , amount easily offset inevitable savings welfare , medicaid , crime , disease , etc . terms electoral reform , buchanan suggests willingness take corrective action should essential pre-condition support any candidate running public office , support border fence should pre-condition support any presidential candidate . also , states should urged enact measures such california proposition 187 , arizona proposition 200 , both which written deny welfare illegal aliens . economic disincentives go beyond merely shutting off welfare spigot would require federal legislation , could consist heavy fines hiring illegals , well jail terms repeat offenders . likewise , i.r.s. could directed assess penalties interest tax obligations not withheld when illegals employed " off-the-books " paid cash . moreover , cities sanctuary policies might penalized reducing amount federal monies they receive , annually , universities favoring illegals lower , " in-state " tuition could penalized same manner . author suggested legal reforms consist ending so-called " chain-migration , " whereby legal immigrant apply his entire extended nuclear family brought here once he becomes citizen . buchanan also advocates we end dual citizenship : if someone votes foreign election , they committed crime : if they serve foreign government or military , they should presumed renounced u.s. citizenship . author also recommends we enact federal laws over-ride local sanctuary laws , end phenomenon " anchor-babies , " whereby child born u.s. automatically citizen , even if his parents here illegally . deporting felons , gang members , drunk drivers additional suggestions . illegals should also ineligible receive social security or " earned income tax credit . " he suggests u.s. deny visa applications and/or foreign aid governments ( such mexico ) might refuse cooperate such reforms . meantime , buchanan recommends we impose immigration moratorium , allowing time national debate what kinds new immigrants we should allow into u.s. ( who knows ? : even republicans might eschew lip service " multiculturalism " if they saw large majority electorate demanded immigrants white , skilled , employable , christian ! ) conclusionmr . buchanan considers immigration " existential crisis our civilization . " vintage buchanan , he sums up problem illegal immigration manner upon which it would difficult improve : " ... they not americans they not belong our home . if we not stop this invasion start repatriating them lands whence they came , we lose our country , we unworthy our fathers who gave this country us - unworthy our children , we , through our softness , squandered their priceless patrimony .

" wait minute , wrong play ! my opinion , much ado nothing very funny book/play i somewhat enjoyed reading it . only bad part it it chick flick ( or its case chick play ) . old english also took away play sometimes . however , most part it understandable . overall , i believe shakespeare probably reason writing play other than just pure entertainment . much ado nothing classic shakespearian type play . it comedy two young couples . one couple benedick beatrice . start play they love one , they just not know it yet . they constantly bickering fighting each other . other couple hero claudio , who madly love each other ( or so they think ) plot make benedick beatrice realize they love each other . they also help form leanato , don pedro , margaret ursula . meanwhile , don pedro evil brother don john his henchmen , conrade borachio , plot break up hero claudio . plan nearly succeeds , rather unusual constable dogberry his somewhat merry men must come rescue claudio hero relationship . i said before , main point shakespeare writing play probably more than entertainment . i believe he also wrote it because he wanted show how crazy love make person . play , beatrice benedick fall love each other . after claudio shames hero , beatrice so upset she asks benedick kills claudio . now presents problem because benedick claudio good friends . first , benedick very reluctant this . so reluctant he refuses this . after she says she not love him any more benedick immediately agrees kill claudio . even though i would probably same thing benedick position , it still amazing what love make you . surprisingly , i actually learned something this play . it simple fact assumptions very , very dangerous . thanks don john his henchmen evil plot , claudio thought he seen hero cheating him borachio . reality , it margaret borachio he saw . acting only what he saw , he shamed hero " killed " her . end , it happily ever after moment . personally , i expected better ending , but that just me . yes , i would recommend this book but i myself not love it . too much love , not enough action drama . however , it very funny , especially constable dogberry ( my favorite character book/play ) . also plot well developed so kept my interest . overall , it good worth reading . i would give book/play 8.11 out 10 . you would probably like it so go buy read it . great play , but it just not me .	-1

this very ambitious book , it covers very diverse set topics gravity . one good things this book it covers lot material isn't usually covered books general relativity or string theory , especially this level detail . it certainly not introduction general relativity or string theory . i would recommend readers unfamiliar these topics study wald polchinski firs t.t he book opens chapters covering differential geometry nother theorem . intent isn't teach readers these topics , but rather establish notation provide high level review . when gravitation introduced it not usual geometrical approach , but it approached theory massless spin two particles , feynman lectures gravitation . it interesting approach showing starting linear theory non-linear terms must included consistency this leads general relativity which leads geometric interpretation gravity . it also includes nice discussion gravitational energy momentum psuedotensor . more detailed consideration non-localizability gravitational energy give throughout book . following this gravitational action covered fair amount detail . addition more common approach considering metric only independent variable theory , he also covers approach where metric connection independent variables . although it less common see palatini formalism it hardly uncommon . it also foundation approach non-string theory approach quantum gravity , i.e. loop quantum gravity . i enjoyed discussion torsion general relativity , this covered more detail than one usually sees . up until this point book covered classical gravity , however approach isn't standard one . approach general relativity one useful understanding material quantum gravity . none this material particularly obscure ( exception teleparallelism ) , but i think it fairly unusual see it all covered one place so much depth . next , author extends poincare algebra including fermionic generators give supergravity . he restricts his coverage only = 1 = 2 supersymmetry . this followed more extensive coverage energy general relativity , mainly focusing non-localizability gravitational energy energy conditions . next few chapters deal various solutions general relativity . first couple , schwarzschild reissner-nordstrom solutions , covered most ( former essentially all ) books general relativity . however , coverage here goes way beyond normal . after quickly getting schwarzschild solution its thermodynamics higher dimensional analogs covered . reissner-nordstrom case there even greater amount material beyond normal . this included : proca lagrangian , majumdar-papapetrou family solutions , static solutions multiple extremal black holes , gravitational solitons , more discussion localizability gravitational energy , thermodynamics , electromagnetic duality ( including extension he relates , u dualities string theory ) , monopoles , chern-simons terms higher dimensional solutions . over next couple chapters more solutions described , some fair amount depth : taub-nut , taub-bolt , bps states , instantons , plane fronted gravity waves , kaluza-klien black holes , bogomol'nyi bound , dehn twits dilaton black holes . it nice seeing all this covered one place ; however , times it reads catalog i wasn't really sure what main point . after chapter supersymmetry book moves study string theory . this comprises final third book . introductory string material presented lightening rate . i would guess most readers exposed string theory first time would overwhelmed . naturally branes also covered . emphasis most this part duality symmetries string theory how they relate various solutions . string part book finishes off describing black hole solutions string theory . one interesting inconsistency book he describes schwarzschild solution gravitational field massive pointlike particle . what makes this interesting earlier book he went great lengths explain schwarzschild solution not gravitational field massive pointlike particle , easiest way see this singularity this spacelike so source can't massive particle . whole i liked this book lot , i thought it many strengths . i wouldn't choose it first book general relativity or string theory , but that not its intent anyway . approach developing gravity isn't usual one ( interestingly he uses + --- signature which fairly uncommon , these days , outside study spinors ) , but it good compliment it one students gravitation should aware . not only because it provides bridge study quantum gravity , but also because it interesting its own right . strength lot interesting , often neglected , topics developed much more detail than usually provided	-1

this lavishly photo-illustrated smoothly-written book details all psilocybin-containing mushrooms generally known up date publication , including those outside species psilocybe some extremely rare ones known only single location or single event ( sometimes mysterious magic mushrooms crop up after storms but never seen again unless spores taken them grown under controlled conditions ) . stamets explains often-conflicting taxonomy psilocybe mushrooms ( one species , example , received two different names because two writing teams who travelled together wrote it up separately -- one published first * their * name " priority , " even though some people use name given other team ; despite name difference mushroom described same species ) . stamets no prude . he writes quite bluntly psilocybin-containing mushrooms ( including his own tripping them ) , he extremely ( justly ) critical other mycologists who not only refuse describe such mushrooms , but , one case stamets cites , said it better people die eating poisonous mushrooms than people able safely identify psilocybin-containing mushrooms ! stamets gives descriptions photos poisonous look-alike mushrooms gives step-by-step identification procedure psilocybin ' shrooms . most cases identification straightforward within few minutes ; other cases look-alikes lethal suspect mushrooms carefully gone over avoid poisoning . one extemely curious phenomenon which stamets describes cases which people " tripped " mushrooms which generally considered non-poisonous which species which not supposed contain * any * psychoactive chemicals ; stamets speculates if these cases genuine , they may represent instances which biochemistry one individual reacted completely unpredictable near-unique way " normal " mushroom . ( i heard some people whose bodies * naturally * manufacture ethanol ordinary sugars food sufficient quantites become drunk without ever consumed liquid alcohol ; these freak instances people tripping non-pyshoactive mushrooms may represent something similar -- rare individuals whose bodies convert innocuous chemicals into psychoactive ones ; since reported cases people who didn't intend eat magic mushroom first place , who probably sworn off mushroom eating forever result their experience , likelihood repeat occurence given individual probably close zero . still , fact such unexpected event occurred all underscores couple points which stamets makes again again : don't eat any wild mushroom which you not positively identified , don't gorge yourself species which you * * identified until you taken small sample see how your own body reacts them . ) one interesting feature book estimate relative potency psilocybin-containing mushrooms explanation why some cultivated mushrooms differ widely potency even though they belong same species . some members species psilocybe actually don't contain any psilocybin all , but apparently all members species either taste bad or too chewy used food , even non-psychoactive ones . only weakness book it not contain section describing numerous cultivated varieties . cubensis , which vary greatly appearance growing requirements ( , according vendors , least ) potency . many these varieties doubtless " gone wild " ( stamets says grounds universities outside courthouses two best places hunt " wild " psilocybin mushrooms ! ) , but there only one listing species photos what presumably wild varities not derived artificial selection growers . stamets true fan mushrooms his commercial website ( he doesn't sell psilocybin mushrooms , way ) gives examples how mushrooms used bioremediation polluted lands used improve yields crops . stamets points out one best places look wild muchrooms land which just hit storm or where humans just ravaged it put up or tear down building . although stamets not gone far off deep end terrence mckenna his brother ( writing under their own names or " ott osric " ) , it apparent he , like many other partakers magic mushrooms , believes them vital part gaia their spread humans part planetary evolution . simple example , those hunting " magic " mushrooms ( whether deliberately or not ) carry magic mushroom spores back where they found , but they also carry spores other species which grow nearby , their turn , vital ecological components even if they aren't psychoactive : just growing * near * psychoactive mushroom gives other mushrooms evolutionary advantage their spores dispersed primates anxious go tripping but whose hair or fur or clothes brush against other species mushroom carry their spores location . it becomes easy see why some people believe psychoactive mushrooms ( especially psilocybe species ) co-evolved humans means enhance biosphere gaia . i give this book five well-deserved stars . i know know other book which contains so much information magic mushroom history mycology provides such clear-cut easy follow steps identifying psilocybin-containg species . if nothing else it beautiful look . ****	1

" petswelcome . com " not give url . ( go figure----they're dotcom company ! ) . libby montana no listings " pets welcome . com " whereas " pets go " four . this happens over over . " pets go " twice fat other book it organized alphabetically state , city ( boldface ) . " petswelcome . com " frustrating me fast , efficient use because first boldface entry not city ( rather motel --- which not alphabetized ! ) you squint find city listings . pain ! two books i would get " pets go " ( i rated it 5 stars fast thorough , complete information ) . i would tempted throw other out car window ! one just gets feeling dotcom generic phoniness when reading " petswelcome . com " . i feel like this book like maze-designed building every other brick missing . i'm dog person go four dogs ( one traveller ) numerous other pets i no involvement book . i hope this helps folks organized ergonomics-minded like me	-1

after reading first three volumes merchant princes i half willing completely write charles stross off . this fantasy series less than impressive while it decent ideas parallel worlds secret families potential really strong series . but merchant princes overall disappointing read . charles stross , other hand , lauded most awards writer sff awarded he picks up nominations almost before he finishes writing work fiction . so maybe it just me . maybe i missing something . stross known more his science fiction than his fantasy , so perhaps if i gave his science fiction shot i would find something would live up hype . i started beginning atrocity archives . atrocity archive short novel which his first published novel archives also includes novella concrete jungle . concrete jungle hugo winner 2005 best novella . i only describe small portion what novel because there just somethings i am unable explain properly . let me say novel set early 2001 there man named bob howard who works laundry london . laundry secret organization which place battle forces darkness . imagine world where nazis attempted tap into netherworld bring all sorts evil support third reich all this possible just science fact . stross gives level detail unreal impossible feels almost prosaic . it remarkable talent . bob howard ( robert . howard reference , anyone ? ) computer guy but wants put field spy type jobs his involvement without sufficient training gets him involved events build beyond what he ever would imagined . bob howard gets involved into this very netherworld evil laundry trying desperately stop . what makes atrocity archives quite bit different than other sff novels this combination lovecraft , len deighton spy novels perhaps little bit neal stephenson . i think charles stross far stronger non-merchant princes work because while atrocity archives read like slow moving spy novel it kept building building became more more interesting exciting find out what happening next . atrocity archives worth time spent reading it . -joe sherr	-1

i confess i didn't get very far this one . if you read this course , i'm very sorry . i'm not academic , but i i read lot philosophy . i'll put lot energy into complex text , but i prefer invest it works enlighten , not confuse . clarity-precision scale , i would push levinas right past " dense " or " challenging " put it somewhere " turgid " " impenetrable . " ( his apologists decry inability human language convey levinas ' sophisticated thoughts . maybe so , but perhaps apology says more his thoughts than it human language . ) any case , it take you long time genuinely read this book . if you're looking truth ( opposed passing grade required course ) , you would better served spending 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own working definition following words : --- " totality " --- " infinity " --- " other " then spend 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own understanding how three interrelated . then get decent translation aristotle metaphysics .

this book ends stating " only understanding heidegger children appreciates their relationship german catastrophe traumas it bred prove capable doing justice their powerful complex philosophical legacy . " this sentence could easily begun book , it effectively introduces what wolin set out : present intellectual historical roots heidegger " children " ( hannah arendt , karl lowith , hans jonas , herbert marcuse ) . whether he succeeds this depends upon how one understands lineage intellectual development , how account any thinking appears new . wolin excellent providing parallel complementary ideas milieu which each " children " lived worked . he gifted eye similar potentially influential observations arguments ; whether means he explained finished product represented each title subjects ' works , distinct question . i'm glad read wolin -- it time worth spending . there numerous proofreading errors (' it ' instead ' if ' , . . ) unsettling mode writing heavily depends upon precision often complex distinctions , but gist his writing never doubt . my understanding heidegger philosophy specifically his relationship national socialism , definitely enhanced . it wolin core use what i call " contagion theory , " gives me greatest pause both his analysis this volume overall utility his work . i found myself mentally summoning voice america fifties , asking " you ever , or you now ... " considering just how i should frame weigh by-now predictable wolin approach addressing thinkers whom he disapproves . disapproval it , far more than mere disagreement . give man his due : he thoughtful obviously bright . whether this means his " contagion " analysis substantively or even fatally flawed , me open question ... whether it would time well spent read yet his volumes .	-1

this thoroughly researched mostly fair-minded account rise 6 most important members bush war cabinet his first term . digging deep into their respective backgrounds , james mann clearly demonstrates how their life histories career experiences shaped their views favor american military dominance , process debunking many lunatic conspiracy theories pass mainstream criticism decision go war iraq conduct war . he also clearly shows just how silly those antiwar loons who pinned such high hopes colin powell pointing out both he richard armitage any rational definition war hawks who merely disagreed rest vulcans when how fight iraq , not whether . yet ..., yet .... though james mann no partisan hack , though he clearly made sincere effort fair unbiased , end his liberal bias seeped through . this shows up most clearly his first annoying , then unintentionally hilarious , finally just plain sad continual assumption worst motives vulcans . when facts available mr. mann sticks them , even taking time debunk some more idiotic conspiracy theories , but when facts absent , mr. mann continually falls into trap assuming venal motives same people he just defended only marginally loonier accusations . saddest thing i am sure mr. mann completely unaware it , would probably respond confused stare if i tried point this out him . he just wouldn't able get it . area where he blinded liberal bias his continual attempts make big issue how people who once opposed democrat foreign policies designed spread democracy turned around supported republican foreign policies designed spread democracy . reason it turns out rather simple . democrat policies condemned because they usually failed , resulting more oppressive dictatorships , while republican policies praised because they usually worked , resulting real democracies ! this actually good microcosm liberal-conservative divide whole host issues : conservatism results-oriented ; liberalism isn't . what this means , sadly , we probably going forced rely more more conservative historians going forward , not because they unbiased , far it , but because they only historians enough self-awareness even attempt guard against their own biases .	-1

northanger abbey , jane austen satirizes what her her late 18th century readers gothic novel . even before ann radcliffe published enormously popular mysteries udolpho 1794 , novel sentiment all rage . such stories heroine likely cry , swoon , moan drop hat . radcliffe her book added other gothic ingredients fear , ghosts , haunted houses , other paranormal phenomena . austen looked down writers who their heroines engage such unseemly behavior even though she later treat seriously same trait sensibility sense sensibility . heroine northanger abbey catherine morland , who seems unlike what later prove typical austen protagonist . catherine start book much more closely allied " sense " half push-pull sense sensibility dichotomy all her works . she daughter prosperous clergyman who travels resort named bath , where she meets falls love henry tilney . there usual romantic plot complications austen novel which normally allow heroine attracted her male counterpart encounter suitable obstacles , all which neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which turn leads higher level moral vision . this case , austen great fun catherine first showing her full sense , then later shifting gears morphing her into standard " sensible " female gothic genre , finally whirling catherine back position reason logic . it takes half book before austen gets gothic satire which it well-known . when catherine arrives northanger abbey , she inexplicably affected conventional gothic trappings place . where earlier catherine would see occurrence might seemed spooky other more stereotyped gothic heroines but not so her , newer catherine now could see same eerie event filled unfounded terror . it only now austen makes clear target her barbed satire . she plainly disgusted other writers who purposefully filled empty heads their heroines gothic terror , but when she same , it excusable since satire , not stereotype , her aim . later , catherine grasp sense returns she able exonerate her own mind general tilney suspected charge murder his wife . end novel , reader introduced theme sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason . catherine morland , later nearly all austen female protagonists , austen suggests choose two extremes , one might seek middle ground so each one complement , rather than supplement other . there simply too many examples extremes who end badly austen works one ignore her implied advice .	1

this one best books i read subject creativity later life . i recommend it heartily . dr. cohen , m.d. amp ; h.d. become acknowledged leader this field his brilliant synthesis his 25 years experience working older adults geriatric physician creativity researcher . quot ; we need new frame reference which picture ourselves growing recognize how influence inner resources life circumstances present us opportunities revive our lives meaningful satisfying ways , quot ; cohen maintains . his experience his patients his studies aging creativity arts led him revise erik erikson model adult development later years . he divided erikson final stages generativity amp ; integrity into four developmental phases which he claims shape way our creative energy grows way we express it . each phase , he says , shaped our chronological age , our history , our circumstances . each phase characterized changes how we view experience life combined psychological , emotional intellectual sense . four phases : 1 . midlife reevaluation/quest phase 2 . liberation phase ( formerly called retirement ) 3 . late-life summing-up phase 4 . encore phase if we look beyond age markers retirement liberation phase search , instead , underlying developmental phase here , we find it defined kind personal liberation combined life experience lifts inhibitions gives us courage ignore social conventions restrict our creative expression . this liberation phase creative endeavors shaped added energy new degree personal freedom comes both psychologically within us externally through retirement . our creative juices may mobilized thought " if not now , when ? " people tend feel pretty comfortable themselves this time , knowing if they should make mistake it won't undo image others them , more importantly , it won't undo image they themselves . this psychological emotional understanding provides new context experimentation , retirement often provides new feeling finally free time try something new . both these inner outer elements liberating additive . this new sense available time personal liberty later life , combined significant life experience , produces new feelings freedom , courage , confidence commonly described men women advanced age . here , too , contrary negative stereotypes , feeling more free allows older individuals experiment , take risk , try something new . most us , we head into our sixties , become more comfortable who we . if we make mistake while trying something new , it doesn't shatter our self-image . so while someone his twenties may not dare take art class fear looking incompetent , doing something unfamiliar , person his forties or beyond much less concerned appearances , more interested experimenting new ways learn . cohen research underscores adventurous nature adults this liberated phase development . his investigations show older adults who not handicapped extenuating circumstances such poor health or financial constraints -- just venturesome their younger counterparts . this greater freedom courage helps explain why throughout history so many older adults their late sixties , seventies or beyond assumed role shapers shakers society . one thinks socrates , copernicus , titian , montaigne , goethe , rembrandt , newton , einstein , nelson mandela , simone de beauvoir , may sarton , eleanor roosevelt , people who rose greatness their later years . advancing years late life , what cohen calls encore stage , there desire -- developmental urgency , really -- affirm life number ways . it might through completing creative work , or resolution longstanding problem , statement waiting said , or right thing hold years . encore phenomenon taps inner pressure many feel or say something before it too late . phrase applies strongly field music , reminding us how many noted musical achievements come late or end musicain or composer career or life cycle -- like late works verdi , liszt , stravinsky . this time advancing age , which creative expression shaped desire make strong , lasting contributions personal or community level , affirm life , take care unfinished business , celebrate one own contribution . this phase typically occurs among those their eighties or older . multidisciplinary dr. cohen cites some fascinating biological studies brain reveal one early fifties late seventies there actually increase both number length branches individual brain cells different parts brain involved higher intellectual functioning ( cohen , . 79 ) these branching changes compensate brain cell loss occur over time . they also give further evidence platicity or modifiabilty brain it ages . something even more interesting these neuro-biological findings they directly correspond timewise unfolding above human potential phases pointing possible biological connection changes human development second half life . these human potential phases combine elements age-based developmental stages described erikson greater fluidity life transitions we experience today . sometimes we might experience phase sync others our age , but not always , age occurrence varies . sometimes they co-exist , intersect , even synergize or combine way adds even greater energy mix . significance these human potential phases they set state new creative thrust different points our lives . our awareness these phases help close gap recognizing our potential acutually harnessing it . knowing natural course development bring us closer tapping our creative potential different times provide much needed measure confidence or faith which we sometimes need begin , change or energize our creative efforts . i only scratched surface this book , but this summary should sufficient indicate its importance . i recommend everyone interested new discoveries human behavior , creativity longevity read it . -john-raphael staude , h.d. proteus60@aol.co	1

dr. williams studies women marine corps men nursing discuss what it like gender minority occupation . her most important point experience differs based upon biological sex . if women male-dominated field it rough not mean men female dominated field it same way . what came across most directly me how much gender still matters . if this book , dr. williams writes men choose avoid nursing whereas male military leaders actively prevent women entering field . moreover , gender complex . female marines see their femininity strength , but male marines see same quality substandard . male nurses get called doctor because patients simply can't fathom idea male nurse . fact , some patients say men practice " male nursing " because idea still seems so novel oxymoronic them . unfortunately , continued reality violence against women documented : male nurses noted male doctors throw things female nurses . i scandalized ! first , i surprised this sociology text so many psychological underpinnings . then again , two disciplines highly interrelated . still , freudian idea earliest memories parental practices affects everything may rub some readers wrong way . author clearly feminist not just some neutral observer . i support women rights , so didn't bother me . however , other readers may indict her " agenda . " me , however , pointing gender inequality legitimate aim . both her discussions nursing marines mentioned military often . thus , i am surprised she not directly cite feminist military scholar cynthia enloe . book starts off saying , " same way studying transgendered people tells us lot mainstream gender , so studying female marines male nurses tell us gender workplace over all . " i would argue transgendered people not studied enough , especially they deal employment settings . i hope more scholars take project . my biggest critique this book how lesbians lesbophobia mostly ignored . author notes heterosexual male nurses go out their way announce their sexual orientation gay male nurses may not receive advantages their straight counterparts . she also mentions gay men expelled military . however , huge numbers lesbians get expelled military too . because this book published 1989 , dr. williams not benefit numerous books printed 1990s spoke lesbian oppression military . still , gay rights activist urvashi vaid noted discrimination against women specifically lesbians longstanding feminist issue . dr. williams doesn't even state military discriminatory policies may why women inclusion marine corps taken given . dr. williams ' erasure here quite problematic . dr. williams quotes several men who say they not money attend medical school thus they became nurses . i don't buy one bit ! you get loans med school if you grades . getting into medical school difficult anybody . undergraduate nursing courses don't stress premedical curriculum way science departments . getting into medical schools such intense weeding process argument informants present here cannot possibly true . start , dr. williams confesses finding female marines talk much easier than finding male nurses . i know it taboo rank oppressions , but i wish author spoken how male femininity punished society more than female masculinity . parents discipline girly boys laugh off tomboyishness . women wear pants , but men punished wearing dresses . thus , maybe men punished more entering nursing than women who enter marine corps . i enjoyed this book , just i everything dr. williams writes . she insightful promising academic . gender radicals traditionalists should investigate what she say	-1

gershom scholem transformed kabbalah into acceptable academic discipline . today many writers/scholars/professors follow his footsteps ( e.g. wolfson idel ) . he , no doubt , us great service . it should noted , however , he historian -- neither scientist nor kabbalist . he appears faithfully presented kabbalistic doctrines , teachnings , etc . middle ages onward . nonetheless , reader should sensitive certain lack scientific viewpoint one hand mystical/experiential knowledge orientation other -- all his works . said , this wonderful book , one his best ( after " major trends jewish mysticism " ) . if you like this book , i'd recommend you also read , " jewish gnosticism-merkabah mysticism-and talmudic tradition . " work here illuminates many main kabbalistic concepts regarding godhead , including shekinah ( god presence or immanance god , which female ) , sephiroth ( emanations god ) , zaddik ( righteous person ) , etc . his voluminous entry jewish encyclopedia kabbalah also published stand-alone volume simply called , " kabbalah . " this work highly recommended it covers lots ground including major kabbalists . any serious student kabbalah find present work necessary addition his/her repertoire . my favorite quote this book page 139 where he quotes great maggid mezerich : " tsaddikim make god , if one may phrase it thus , their unconscious . " rabbi dov baer mezhirech ( great maggid ) or torah ( korets 1804 ) . 115b jerusalem 1956	-1

' swann love ' tells story . swann how he fell love one odette d'crecy , woman not his class who seduces him then breaks his heart . ' place-names : name ' we read slightly older marcel , his first attempts winning heart gilberte , daughter . swann . my favorite image swann way comes ' place names ' - image odette d'crecy strolling down avenue acacias alone , which proust includes his diatribe against death elegance . purpose writing search lost time recover his forgotten memories , proust tale not told series interconnected events , but collection interwoven memories - some them incomplete . [ short novella , ' swann love ' , contained novel exception - though still told internalized perspective , . swann . ] this format , description trumps plotline dialogue . his descriptions - tapestries cathedrals , child longing his mother , beauty words pain falling love - first rate . i found many times reading this book lot like looking great painting , or sunset - soothing , [ also exception ' swann love ' , where i found myself completely aggravated . swann hating odette . author calm you but also create characters capable arousing passionate anger must great . ] swann way highly recommended .	1

pollan taps into almost universal wish -- doing something else living . his strength here , his previous books , cheerleader . everyone wants told , " go ahead , you it , " pollan tells us just . since he defines second acts so broadly ( couple who decide buy second home country , instance ) , nearly everyone considered candidate second act . he outlines steps you should take before taking leap . decide just what it you want don't want , determine what financial family support you need , etc . making orderly exercise out it , it seems more attainable . pollan good organizing us putting positive spin doing something risky frightening most us . i disagree him one point , asking family members money . he says your family wants you happy , if they planning leaving you money their , instance , you should tell them you need it now . or , if you don't willing wealthy grandparents , ask siblings or parents loan . this sounds like mistake me , but maybe pollan knows better . it would also nice summary steps end book . if you thinking second act ( who isn't ) , you could probably figure out pollan steps your own , but it nice them organized you friendly mentor cheering you .	-1
john searle philosopher philosopher . he also scrupulously honest fault . when reading him , one never stop wonder whether he really believes what he saying . present work , " construction social reality " ( csr ) " no exception . lucid , cogent , packed insights , csr vintage searle -- thinker who just seems get better better age . nowadays one no more ignore searle than could medieval thinker ignore aristotle , or modern thinker ignore kant . when i begin writing any philosophical subject , i always check see whether searle close . csr offers most perspicuous account " social facts " or " institutional facts " any work i know , except , perhaps , chapter 5 searle earlier work , " intentionality . " i would recommend anyone interested subject read chapter together csr . focus chapter 5 " background . " searle develops this notion great length csr , especially chapter 6 . ( great strength csr logical progression topics one chapter next . ) idea background around least since husserl heidegger , key element heidegger analysis " time . " sure , searle not slavishly follow heidegger ; two thinkers very different takes what intentionality . ( especially lucid analysis difference searle heidegger found hubert dreyfus ' classic introduction heidegger , " being-in-the-world . " ) but anyone who second thoughts running headlong into thicket heideggerian prose hardly better than start searle . after all , when we're doing philosophy , it always good idea understand problem we're trying solve , questions we're trying answer . heidegger doesn't make it easy this . searle . not searle perfect . like most philosophers , he doesn't always resist urge engage speculative metaphysics . this he early csr . example , he writes : " since our investigation ontological , i.e. , how social facts exist , we need figure out how social reality fits into our overall ontology , i.e. , how existence social facts relates other things exist . we make some substantive presuppositions how world fact order we even pose questions we trying answer . we talking how social reality fits into larger ontology , but order , we describe some features larger ontology . " ( csr , 5-6 . ) yes , we make presuppositions . but here one point which searle heidegger differ ; i'm inclined side heidegger . we don't really get clear what our presuppositions ; , fact , it doubtful we ever . when we think we , we invariably get entangled speculative venture . whole foundationalist notion we must begin " clear distinct ideas " rings bit archaic nowadays . searle tries achieve clarity accepting incontrovertible axioms which , him , mark out boundaries any human cognitive enterprise . listen searle : " truth , us , most our metaphysics derived physics ( including other natural sciences ) . many features contemporary natural science conception reality still dispute still problematic . . . but two features our conception reality not up grabs . they not , so speak , optional us citizens late twentieth early twenty-first century . it condition your educated person our era you apprised these two theories : atomic theory matter evolutionary theory biology . " ( csr , 6 . ) it true educated person must " apprised " these two theories . it doesn't follow however , one give them foundational significance which searle claims them . what matters not our metaphysics , but our presuppositions . , heidegger would insist , we can't get clear them appealing science . fact , science not interested our " conception reality " or ultimate origins things . if our presuppositions get way our ability science , we may change them part . but this doesn't mean we draw picture ultimate reality its totality order proceed science . again , this just not something scientists care . i submit searle analysis institutional facts go forward whether he committed naturalist or believer divine revelation . but then , again , none this matters reader who wants know how social reality put together . , this definitive source . searle long ago earned his status primus inter pares philosophical community . whether he much thinker everyone else less certain . age when muddled thinking deemed virtuous , most people learned all they know philosophy oprah winfrey , one must probably conclude searle always home among his own . he'll never invited appear daytime talk show . his credit , i'm confident he wouldn't accept invitation . i wish i could give csr ten stars instead five . aidan mcdowell	1

first , clear couple things up : 1851 edition pearl great price published independently followers joseph smith england -- after he died , you understand ( 1844 ) . he couldn't possibly telling two different stories 1823 1851 because 1851 he dead . original pogp actually pamphlet put together people england who wanted remember some joseph smith teachings . i haven't actually read original document so i can't know if words " angel nephi " appear there " man truth " claims , but if they he lucky enough read them , then he should enough scholar know stacks stacks other sources attesting joseph smith testimony regarding his moroni visitation . " angel nephi " first edition independent missionary pamphlet safely seen simple typo ethusiastic printer . 2 ) joseph smith convicted " glass looking , fortune telling or prophesying " ? yes he . yes god forbid israelites deuteronomy fortune telling , but what those two things each other ? just because some local preachers tried persecuting smith under catch-all law 1826 mean he really something so terrible if he broke fortune telling commandment law moses ( 2000 . . ) ? didn't jesus say him law moses away ? even so , i believe fortune telling looked still wrong ( see peter book acts ) but wasn't what joseph smith doing or convicted under catch-all law my mind -- he prophecying , something may no no under some 1826 law , but a-ok lord . see bible . now , all i left say , see this book . i love it . it clears up lot bible fits into it quite nicely ( quite literally )	1

i really like way judy budnitz writes . i picked up flying leap years ago hooked . she one those authors when i go bookstore i look up see if anything new released . i don't know if she everyone though . her stories tend highly . . . imaginative . they almost like fairy tales , allegories may or may not deeper meaning . honest , i've never really looked . her writing just so rich full flavor i tend just devour stories sitting not think them later . her writing matured " nice big american baby " darker feeling than flying leap . i would even argue it darker than her novella , " if i told you once , " which its dark parts , but really straddles space flying leap baby . my favorite story far this collection " saving face " story two people living imaginary authoritarian regime ruled benign prime minister . perhaps it sign her maturation author ( or perhaps me reader ) i keep this story percolating my head going over themes true love , devotion , happenstance , self play this story . it really very very good .

i fortunate study george burt when he teaching university michigan school music late seventies early eighties . just before he left teach rice university , he taught course film music i fortunate attend . david raksin few other film composers came spoke us their scores films we watched some sequences ( obviously , laura one them ) . this book came later i am sure burt used it his teaching rice . this book emphasizes works hugo friedhofer , alex north , david raksin , leonard rosenman , but they used illustrate points burt wants make rather than study composers works themselves . i remember burt emphasized music film not something added it anymore than music accompanying theme fugue separate it any material way . , what screen what score provides form counterpoint fuse into whole . neither music nor film complete or effective without other . if you watch films this mind , you notice how some handle music so effectively , some less well , some just awful use music ( this apart - but contributing factor - success film " work " ) . this book came out before digital computerized equipment used film today , but musical aspects spot i am sure technical considerations synchronization so forth still matter great deal . means ease integration doesn't change difficulty conception or composition . there six chapters : 1 ) story thing : music vital role , should film music heard ?, contrapuntal aspect , associative power music . 2 ) characterization : individual people , groups people , symbolic meanings , emotional context , ambient time place , source music3 ) emphasizing dramatic line : musical accents , missing beat or pulse , pacing4 ) sequence unit : best years our lives ( homecoming scene ) , laura ( apartment scene ) , east eden ( climactic scene)5 ) sound function when music absent : matter fact dialogue , psychological containment , acoustic space , moments anguish , telling quality ambient sound , question realism6 ) practical matters human element : spotting process , timings , synchronization , generalized compositional approaches , orchestration orchestra , synthesizer , music mix dubbing . i think this music invaluable composers arrangers wanting working film , tv , even commercials . however , i also think those wanting direct produce these works would benefit reading through this material . sure , there music examples someone not trained reading music find impossible , but examples not critical understanding points text . they add depth , but points made words text . anyone interested this topic film buff or general reader find their appreciation film music greatly enhanced . enjoy ! recommended	1

i loved this book rushdie . i first introduced it selection seminar course , found myself going back number stories re-read them - something i almost never . first three stories take place india play greatly western readers perceptions indians indian culture . second selection three stories takes place west . some contemporary while one actually futuristic , bordering sci-fi . last three fussion these two worlds . stories rich their imagery , definitely multi-layered . they prove entertaining read casual reader , well extremely intriguing read those who involved book club or academic enviornment . while some stories difficult because indian dialect or else due point which reader dropped into story , i would encourage one keep reading . it untangle into perhaps one best short stories you encounter , they written this way reason . rushdie , nothing left chance , there reason everything these stories whether it starting point , dialect , time frame , character name , etc . definitely get this book . it worth every penny	1

connie willis interesting writer this interesting book , page-turner well . it very good read . but i some misgivings . i agree this not your typical " sci-fi " work , but neither , reviewer mentioned , it well threshed out historical fiction , such neal stephenson gives us baroque cycle . other words , willis doesn't exactly transcend any genre here . rather , she mixes several together way not completely satisfactory . ironically , what rather bothers one how entertaining this book . it , like much willis fiction , heavily dependent droll , wodehousian humour . this used perfect effect works such say nothing dog . it used perfect effect here beginning where mrs. gaddison , example , much like bertie wooster aunt agatha , serves perfect comic foil droll sort wit --- but then deaths start piling up , both eras , it isn't really until we near end dunworthy becomes ill , these wry lines situational comedies ended - characters ' deaths . there distinct literary dissonance book one smirking or tittering until final , harrowing chapters . all this said , book some finer points , finest which willis evocations medieval landscape ; i reminded bit singrid unset kristin lavransdatter ( which , those who want real historical fiction this sort , definitely place turn ) . book truly manage convey christina rossetti picture " bleak midwinter long ago " quoted beginning " book two " . so , what verdict ? - doomsday book good , engrossing read , if rather flawed literary sense . i'd recommend it anyone who wants something more than mere page turner but something less than true literary fiction - , kristin lavransdatter where cast your eye .	-1

this book reasonable job overview reich life most his early work , though it fails thorough example sharaf " fury earth " . author gives his impressions reich work , philosopher discourse comparative review reich behavioral findings they relate modern ideas psychiatry psychology ... matter he reasonable job . however , what bothered me terrible misrepresentation reich biophysical research . corrington either not know , or knows but some reason fails discuss , multitude controlled studies undertaken both during reich lifetime after his death , which verified more controversial aspects his biological orgone energy discoveries . so , example , reader learn nothing : 1 ) demeo 1970s university kansas replication reich cloudbuster research , showing positive results , nor demeo global cross-cultural study " saharasia " which used standard anthropological evidence prove global accuracy reich sex-economic findings origins violence . 2 ) double-blind controlled studies . mueschenich . gebauer university marburg early 1980s , " psycho-physiological effects reich orgone accumulator " , verifying exactly reich original findings human physiological response orgone accumulator . also not mentioned , additional replication study orgone accumulator . hebenstreit university vienna .

i really expected enjoy this - i love dams ' dorothy martin series . i usually read first two books before making up my mind series , but this so bad i didn't heart read next . best part book evocation time place : turn-of-the century indiana perspective young swedish immigrant working maid studebakers . hilda one four johansson children sent america find themselves place then earn passage rest family . overall story rather flimsy . hilda deeply concerned immigrant , almost any immigrant , blamed when member prominent family murdered . when she learns police left patrol wagon question chinese guest notre dame , mr. kee , hilda decides she only she save him . she arrives notre dame after exhausting walk learn what lazy less righteous us would guessed ourselves : 1 . police gone ( they head start they riding wagon , pete sake ! ) 2 . priests notre dame could more him than she could , i.e. provide alibi . but very contrived sub-plot , mr. kee flees before police arrive so hilda save him later . her duties maid don't leave her much opportunity investigation . servants ' gossip network supposed hilda advantage , but she finds killer dumb , stupid , luck , during unnecessary piece folly . killer actions little hard credit : i don't want spoil story , but means opportunity important motive . i'm lot trouble figuring out how killer managed pull off crimes . why would killer so stupid confront hilda under disadvantageous circumstances ? my guess dams some scenes her head then connected them best she could often awkward seques . my last problem book hilda attitudes toward us . miserable experience immigrants major theme this book , i don't doubt lot immigrants hard lot , but why , experienced hellish american life , she her siblings trying bring rest family here ? wouldn't you think they'd saving get back sweden ? i don't expect fairy-tale , but portrayal hilda seems incomplete .	-1
i just read this book enjoyed it thoroughly . however , title somewhat misleading , this not conventional biography . other than few chapters her childhood early education , book arranged " theme " chapters , each focussing particular person or aspect her life , illustrated , heavily annotated , letters poems related theme . i ended book more questions her life than i beginning . many them barely addressed book , or just hinted . perhaps book intended readers who already very familiar biographical details . just one example , author mentions several times eye problem led one emily rare trips away her home treatement boston . i kept thinking sooner or later some further details this eye problem would revealed , but there never more than few widely scattered sentences it . perhaps there isn't enough evidence able conjecture nature problem , but author doesn't even seem think it important enough detail require weighing evidence . likewise her mother long illness , which played role emily withdrawal world , mentioned but its nature not discussed , other than mention she paralyzed near end her life . she suffer stroke ? she lucid ? since emily her primary caregiver , it would seem these details might bear her own emotional state during years this illness would warrant least some speculation . even emily own final illness remains mystery . we learn her sister blamed it ill treatment received her sister-in-law , her doctor attributed it " nerves " . however , other hints , it seems progessively debilitating illness . there never much paragraph entire book which speculates nature this fatal illness or how much she might incapacitated first attack june 1884 her death may 1885 . " nerves " seems me insufficient explanation death poet after illness eleven months . we sure fainting spell related final illness ? she ill entire eleven months ? how long she bedridden ? author doesn't even pose these questions . book 821 pages , there no index entry " illness " . " death [ ed ] " 7 widely scattered brief entries , one which footnote , one which 13-sentence entry how her death affected her brother , one which text her obituary three which describe her funeral(on pages 273 , 575 667 , show how scattered they ) . seventh entry refers her obituary , but seems mistake , i find no mention her death or obituary page cited . book especially good life her brother austin , also good her father . her mother sister remain mysterious , probably because they not much more exposed public scrutiny than emily herself . it obvious her sister nearly much recluse emily , or least perceived such their neighbors . such scattered book , there inevitably good deal repetition details . three mentions emily funeral cited above , example , mostly identical . poems also quoted part or their entirety multiple times . there index poems pages which they discussed , which useful understanding context some these , although author acknowledges dating poems presents many problems . there chronology beginning book , which really closest there temporal ordering poet life . i would suggest photocopying it using it bookmark , because there little chronological ordering , even within chapters times . i found myself asking such things , " this before her brother marriage or after ? her father still alive when this happened ? " matter fact , because i didn't chronology front me , i surprised realize , when i almost finished book , emily father still alive during period her most intense literary activity . after early chapter devoted her father life , he not often mentioned again , i somehow remained impression he died much earlier her life . much i enjoyed this book , i am left wanting book fill gaps . however , i learned enough partisanal nature her biographers wary choosing one .	-1

i recall time , i worked large parallel unix debugger , only slowly collected facts scraps necessary knowledge progress . i always wondered , why not single book written , which would solely devoted architecture , design implementation symbolic debuggers ? i saw this book announced , my expectations high . could this help organizing my knowledge debuggers , collected so far semi confidential industry reports or white papers , 3-4 dissertations , several implementations , plus some 10-15 conference papers vague descriptions implementations , claims spectacular achievements or mere theoretical ideas ? no , unfortunately this not so . this book , or rather " booklet " very incomplete . it literally not told me any single detail which i would not known already . example , missing description very standard unix interface control hold process . since this not scientific book providing more generic foundations process tracing ( such tracking very long time running programs , replay techniques , generating snapshots etc . etc . ) than i would least expect solid practice orientation . this should include complete discussion several assemblers typical architectures , because they provide sometimes completely different means implementing breakpoints , watchpoints or support threads . many cases debugger must , or supported cooperating compiler . several interesting ideas implemented back ends , which may greatly help supporting breakpoints , finding function prologues , dealing exceptions asynchronous signals . i also miss specifications good comparison two most common formats holding symbolic information , stabs dwarf ! etc . etc ., this list missing facts issues could go . usually i call book like this one " blah blah novel .

following in-depth review this book . but very abbreviated version : it good book few shortcomings . good read though some great strategies america . critique charles pena new book american strategy face al qaeda offers solid plan defeating america enemy , but suffers few shortcomings . overall , however , plan focusing al qaeda , using special forces capture kill leadership while simultaneously removing motivation behind terrorist attacks solid one . our nation leaders would well read this book take heed mr. pena advice . writing editing comments before delving into mr. pena arguments , there few shortcomings writing editing book we should cover . first few chapters rely too heavily quotes political leaders , sometimes five or more direct quotes single page . while this works well evidence , reader would better served one or two quotes getting directly point , backed up additional cites footnotes or endnotes , followed analysis quote . it takes nothing away mr. pena analysis , but would serve make first few chapters more readable . second quibbling point mr. pena tortured analogy al qaeda quantum physics . mr. pena spends several paragraphs describing wave/particle duality light before going talk organizational structure al qaeda . but while light both wave particle same time , al qaeda not both structured hierarchical organization distributed nodal network same time . al qaeda simply distributed nodal network , only true leadership occurs ideological leadership . again , this not affect mr. pena analysis al qaeda , but it serve confuse reader this tortured analogy . use other analogies , especially focusing eastern theology , somewhat better analogy itself shorter . but i still cannot understand how al qaeda composed both yin yang . when using analogies general , it would seem better compare something not generally understood ( al qaeda ) something commonly understood reader ( not usually eastern religions or quantum physics ) . but course all these objections minor we should move more depth discussion mr. pena analysis al qaeda american policy . america focus mr. pena book contains one major assumption upon which whole book argumentation based . assumption al qaeda foremost threat america . while some may take this doctrine , others not , mr. pena not sufficient job backing up this assumption . let us take , example , al qaeda attacks directly american interests last two decades : 1 . world trade center - 1993 ( unsuccessful)2 . african embassies -19983 . uss cole - 20004 . 9/11 - 2001all them course devastating reprehensible , but only one effect doing real damage america 9/11 . yet , five years later , truly not much changed america . change greater new york itself , but five years later they still haggling over wtc site . while 3,000 deaths attack tragic , it pales comparison more than 42,000 die every single year auto accidents america . al qaeda may only group out there actually wherewithal attack america , but even their most devastating attack no means brought america down or even threatened so . it far more devastating effect not immediate deaths or impact economy , but changes it produced america foreign policy , which generated additional support our enemies far fewer friends america . truth al qaeda not actual threat america or american way life , but they threat american power influence world , bring fight american soil . such , they deserve hunted down destroyed , but we should so context broader campaign increase america power influence . america today most powerful nation earth ever seen . only current international threat still comes nuclear arsenals russia china , which only groups able actually destroy america itself . but we successfully used deterrence minimize risk those countries . biggest threat america today , through bad leadership , we misuse our power influence cause it decline . this would allow other state non-state entities arise threaten not only our dominance world affairs , but our very country . thus , while it good consider america positive influence world , we should look america power influence world affairs strong protector our freedoms our democracy . while many mr. pena suggestions excellent defeating al qaeda , he seems believe this conflict more protection " homeland " than protection american supremacy . it not " homeland " al qaeda after , it american supremacy itself . yielding supremacy al qaeda may temporarily protect homeland , but it lead lessening american interests abroad . successful presidents over past century recognized , peaceful prosperous world leads peaceful prosperous america . i discuss some strategies defeating al qaeda while simultaneously maintaining expanding american power influence later , but first let us discuss al qaeda itself more depth . nature beast mr. pena excellent job stating what al qaeda goals ambitions . he also reiterates it not america al qaeda hates , but america effects islamic world . this true , not stated often enough . al qaeda not some evil demon pits we must slay goodness world . al qaeda instead group human beings ambition ideology back up ambition . their ambition reform ( revolution ) muslim world return it " pure " state when it led caliphs . their ideology anyone who interferes this ambition not true muslim so obstacle their path . they also less stringent regard either their own lives or lives others , especially non-muslims , world . these ambitions ideologies put al qaeda into direct conflict america , which its power influence acts either maintain status quo middle east ( all assorted authoritarian unpleasantness ) or push increased democracy improved freedoms ( we , rather unsuccessfully , iraq ) . so al qaeda united states simply two groups different ambitions ideologies compete power world stage . america already vast power influence while al qaeda attempting gain its own power influence . because power differential involved this competition , one only rational choices al qaeda accomplish its ambitions conduct asymmetrical warfare . asymmetrical warfare term used often connotation vietnam describe how small , mobile , ideologically committed force used surprise , terror , propaganda defeat largest military power world . just vietnam , al qaeda not militarily defeat united states ( nor could it ) . they must simply win propaganda campaign . they use terrorism accomplish this . this because every atrocious act they commit , united states ( or their own local governments ) cracks down . these crack downs usually accompany oppression some sort because terrorists mixed among local population . oppression breeds resentment creates more recruits al qaeda who then uses those recruits more atrocious acts . thus cycle continues , al qaeda strengthening every iteration . so mr. pena absolutely right saying our continued presence middle east , especially our occupation iraq , merely leads additional recruits . but what mr. pena not focus enough al qaeda essentially guerilla group . their genius they one first such groups truly go global . while most guerillas local fighters battling local governments , al qaeda global organization battling global superpower . their ability go global aided international transport communication . understanding al qaeda guerilla organization helpful though because al qaeda relies popular support . without friends associates hide them , or without friendly local mosques recruit , al qaeda would not able function . mr. pena absolutely right while leadership important , it this popular support must destroyed order organization cease functioning . crushing al qaeda while maintaining strong america mr. pena advice dealing al qaeda fairly simple : crush leadership remove motivation . this excellent advice fact practiced successfully before countries when non-state actors rise up challenge state . key here use both iron fist velvet glove . leadership crushed example all others not repeat their folly challenging state . same time , much what ideology demanding ( al qaeda case , withdrawal america middle east ) granted order take away motivation future rabble rousing . mr. pena correctly points out american policy middle east blatantly self serving revolves around oil . our need oil something we change ( good domestic policies ) , besides which , global market oil means we need not cozy up unsightly arab regimes . main complaint arab world america movements into iraq not america trying bring democracy into region but america only seeking iraqi oil . if america wishes quiet sympathy jihadist movement , then we need act upon our principles region . this not mean overthrowing every tin pot dictator ( or saddam hussein ) . it mean not supporting tin pot dictators just because they our tin pot dictators , however . if islamic governments elected , it means supporting those governments free democracies ( providing elections free subsequent quashing freedoms not occur ) , even if we not always agree their policies . principled america america far easier support far less easy attack . principled america would also work hard minimize abuses civil liberties . while we rightly condemn actions few abu graib , we not address systematic philosophy underlying system allowed such torture occur . large part systematic philosophy seen manifested guantanamo well . locking individuals up without charges years end policy tin pot dictators , should not policy united states . if we want world believe we stand freedom democracy , then we must practice what we preach . it separation our noble words our ignoble actions gives world pause leads hatred resentment america . we must follow our noble words noble actions insure our long term security . it may slightly hamper efforts short term , but our far more important long term goal victory over terrorists hearts minds world . while perhaps mr. pena not want delve too deeply into politics here , failing mention guantanamo , which one strongest arguments against america rallying cry al qaeda , shortsighted . mr. pena also absolutely correct advocating change our methods hunting al qaeda . we no longer live world warsaw pact . troops should shifted around our military should focus not submarines , b-2 bombers , new fangled fighter jets . instead , we should focus special forces able fight insurgencies . unlike mr. pena , i not believe this requires shrinkage personnel . i believe we must stay iraq because leaving it allow terrorists home back much like afghanistan . but we need shift cold war outlook military able deal modern threats non-state actors indigenous insurgencies . special forces good localized intelligence critical tracking down leadership al qaeda bringing them justice . while mr. pena correct their organization flexible adaptable , each time we make example one their leaders , it hopefully discourage others . this aspect our operation less important , however , because it very difficult dissuade martyrs . so while we should focus catching bin laden his ilk , our main focus should eliminating his basis popular support . conclusion while book contain some shortcomings , i not think i would like live mr. pena isolationist united states , mr. pena offer us hopeful way combating al qaeda . we must bring fight them . but we must define fight fight hearts minds islamic world . we not winning fight supporting arab autocrats or invading arab lands . instead , we need adopt principled foreign policy work rebuild our support not only around region but around world . doing so , we take away critical popular support al qaeda relies upon . combined operations destroy al qaeda leadership , this offers us best chance destroying al qaeda creating stronger america process	-1
